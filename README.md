## Self Evaluation

### Functionality
**Meets Expectations**


Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

### Object Oriented Programming
**Above Expectations/Meets Expectations**


I implemented a module for generating keys which is used in both the encryption and decryption classes. Classes are broken into logical components and no class has access to information/behaviors they shouldn't know about. I'm not sure the module is completely necessary if I had kept my encryption and decryption classes together which is why I put myself in the middle of above and meets expectations. Each method has single responsibility.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
**Above Expectations**


Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. No methods are longer than 10 lines long. Most enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen.

### Test Driven Development
**Above Expectations**


I used stubs in my enigma class spec to test the random generation of keys. Every method is tested and coverage metrics shows 100% coverage.
