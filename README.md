# Self Evaluation

## Functionality
**Meets Expectations**


Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.

## Object Oriented Programming
**Meets Expectations**


 No class has access to information/behaviors they shouldn't know about. I combined my key/shift generating methods into my Cryption class because I didn't have any other classes that needed access to those methods.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
**Meets Expectations**


I named all classes, methods, and variables to clearly communicate their purpose. I used proper indentation and syntax is consistent throughout. All methods are shorter than 10 lines and no line is more than 80 characters. Most enumerables/data structures are the most efficient. A hash was used to create the shifts and easily call the values based on the index of the shift within the hash.

## Test Driven Development
**Above/Meets Expectations**


I used stubs in my enigma class spec to test the random generation of keys and date. Additional testing was done to test the class of the date to ensure 100% test coverage. Testing is implemented to ensure all characters not included in the array do not change or break the code. Tests are performed to ensure capitalized letters are downcased. Every method is tested and coverage metrics shows 100% coverage.
