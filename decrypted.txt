don't let me show cruelty
though i may make mistakes
don't let me show ugliness
though i know i can hate
and don't let me show evil
though it might be all i take
show me love
show me love
show me love
don't let me think weakly
though i know that i can break
keep me away from apathy
while i am still awake
and don't let me think too long of the one i'm bound to face
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
show me love
